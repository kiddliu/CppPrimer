Section 19.1 Controlling Memory Allocation
------------------------------------------

>Exercise 19.1: Write your own `operator new(size_t)` function using `malloc` and use `free` to write the `operator delete(void*)` function.

The code page 823 just works.

>Exercise 19.2: By default, the `allocator` class uses `operator new` to obtain storage and `operator delete` to free it. Recompile and rerun your `StrVec` programs (ยง 13.5, p. 526) using your versions of the functions from the previous exercise.

```cpp
// TODO:
```
