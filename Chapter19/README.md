Chapter 19 Specialized Tools and Techniques
===========================================

Section 19.1 Controlling Memory Allocation
------------------------------------------

>Exercise 19.1: Write your own `operator new(size_t)` function using `malloc` and use `free` to write the `operator delete(void*)` function.

The code page 823 just works.

>Exercise 19.2: By default, the `allocator` class uses `operator new` to obtain storage and `operator delete` to free it. Recompile and rerun your `StrVec` programs (ยง 13.5, p. 526) using your versions of the functions from the previous exercise.

```cpp
// TODO:
```

Section 19.2 Run-Time Type Identification
-----------------------------------------

>Exercise 19.3: Given the following class hierarchy in which each class defines a `public` default constructor and virtual destructor:
```cpp
    class A { /* ... */ };
    class B : public A { /* ... */ };
    class C : public B { /* ... */ };
    class D : public B, public A { /* ... */ };
```
which, if any, of the following `dynamic_cast`s fail?
```cpp
    (a) A *pa = new C;
        B *pb = dynamic_cast<B*>(pa);
    (b) B *pb = new B;
        C *pc = dynamic_cast<C*>(pb);
    (c) A *pa = new D;
        B *pb = dynamic_cast<B*>(pa);
```

(a) Success

(b) Fails

(c) Success. PS: by the definition of the code, there's ambiguous and it can be fixed by making class A inheritance declaration virtual.

> Exercise 19.4: Using the classes defined in the first exercise, rewrite the following code to convert the expression `*pa` to the type `C&`:
```cpp
    if (C *pc = dynamic_cast<C*>(pa)) {
        // use C's members
    } else {
        // use A's members
    }
```

```cpp
    A* pa = new c;
    if (C *pc = dynamic_cast<C*>(pa)) {
        C &alias = *pc;
    } else {
        // use A's members
    }
```

>Exercise 19.5: When should you use a `dynamic_cast` instead of a virtual function?

The book says `we can use one of the RTTI operators if we cannot use a virtual`. `virtual` is not possible for constructors and static functions...
